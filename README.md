## General info
Buyers visit the site to search for products they want to buy from individual sellers. 
The site uses cookies to store user sessions. This project was done in agroup of four, in an agile methodology. 
We divided all tasks into weekly sprints. 
During the project we used tools such as github, heroku and jira. My tasks included:
-creating a module for adding reviews to a product (database CRUD),
-Frontend for register and sign in form
-Home tab
-responsiveness of the website
-creation of footer and navigation bar
